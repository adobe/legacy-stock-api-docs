<a id="stock-integration-with-magento"></a>
### Where can I learn about the Adobe Stock integration with Magento?

Users of Magento Commerce 2.3.4 and newer have access to a pre-built integration with Adobe Stock inside the Page Builder. This allows users to search, license, and download Stock assets without leaving the Magento platform. Learn more about the [Adobe Stock Integration](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/cms/adobe-stock.html) in the Magento documentation.


<a id="definitions-and-terms"></a>
## Definitions and terms

Here are the definitions of some standard acronyms and terms used throughout this document.

**POD.** Print-on-Demand

**DAM/MAM.** Digital Asset Management/Media Asset Management

**API.** Application Programming Interface

**Standard content.** For the purposes of this document, Standard content is a group of images (photos, vectors and illustrations) which consist of Adobe Stock's micro-stock collection, [hosted here](https://stock.adobe.com/images). All assets in this class can be licensed for one credit with a Standard license (see below), and this license allows downloading the asset at full resolution. 

__Standard license.__ This is a limited type of license offered on most Stock assets, including all Standard content (see above). Under the Print on Demand model, a Standard license may be used to print one good. This is different from Extended licenses, which may be used for unlimited prints, but at a much higher cost. For more details see [Adobe Stock License Information](https://stock.adobe.com/license-terms).

**Enterprise account model.** Offers advanced options and volume pricing for Print-on-demand. Requires an Adobe Enterprise contract.

**OAuth integration.** A technical workflow in which users must login to Adobe Stock to authorize their licenses.

**Service Account integration**. A technical workflow where the application can authenticate to Adobe Stock without any human user interaction. This method is only available for Enterprise accounts.

## Print on demand FAQ

<a id="what-are-the-main-objectives-of-the-print-on-demand-use-case"></a>
### What are the main objectives of the print on demand use case?

You can implement the Search API and display search results from the Adobe Stock database. When your customer places an order, we require purchase of one standard license\* per each produced item. For example, if you customer order 5 posters with the same image, you need acquire 5 licenses for the image.

\* Licenses must be from Enterprise licenses under _the Enterprise account model_.

Consumer image subscriptions (subscription plans available at: <https://stock.adobe.com/plans> and https://stock.adobe.com/teams) **cannot be used** for print on demand. .

<a id="what-type-of-assets-can-i-access-by-using-adobe-stock-api-for-print-on-demand"></a>
### What type of assets can I access by using Adobe Stock API for print on demand?

Technically, the API will give access to any kind of asset, including Premium, Video, 3D, Templates, etc.

However, from a Legal standpoint, Print on Demand customers may access __only Standard assets__ and must therefore *filter out* Premium content and other non-Standard asset types. If you need access to other types of content in your application, please [contact us](mailto:Grp-AdobeStockPartnerships@adobe.com?subject=Adobe%20Stock%20API%20FAQ%20-%20non%20standard%20assets).

**Standard assets**. All Standard photos, vectors and illustrations are found here: <https://stock.adobe.com/images>

**Premium assets**. Premium content is anything found here: <https://stock.adobe.com/premium>. In addition, Premium content will have a “Premium” banner on them on the Adobe Stock website. The API has other signifiers and data indicating that an asset is Premium.

![Premium banner](premium_assets_banner.png)

To filter out Premium content from Stock API search results, see the [Stock API FAQ](https://www.adobe.io/apis/creativecloud/stock/docs.html#!adobe/stock-api-docs/master/docs/15-faq.md).

<a id="dams-faq"></a>
## DAMs FAQ

<a id="do-i-need-to-sign-a-contract-to-build-my-dammam-platform-integration"></a>
### Do I need to sign a contract to build my DAM/MAM platform integration?

This type of integration typically doesn’t require signing a contract. The Stock API is free and open to any developer who creates an Adobe ID (personal) account and can be used to search for Stock assets and download watermarked previews.

Further, the developer can create an Adobe OAuth integration, which will allow end-users to sign in and access their own accounts. From here, they can license new assets or download previously licensed assets from their license history.

If the DAM provider needs to create an integration for an Adobe Enterprise customer, some additional steps will be required. Please contact us for more information on this use case.

<a id="does-adobe-stock-have-a-pre-built-integration-with-the-_____-dam-platform-or-can-adobe-stock-build-an-integration-with-____-platform"></a>
### Does Adobe Stock have a pre-built integration with the \_\_\_\_\_ DAM platform? (or) Can Adobe Stock build an integration with \_\_\_\_ platform?

Adobe Stock is working with multiple DAM partners to create new integrations, but currently the only available integration with the [Adobe Experience Manager](https://www.adobe.com/marketing/experience-manager.html) (AEM) Assets platform. If you are an AEM user, see [more information here](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/kt/assets/using/adobe-stock-aem-assets-technical-video-setup.html).

Adobe will be happy to work with any platform provider or customer who wishes to create a new integration, and can provide technical support, sample code and architecture guidance, but does not have the resources to perform the integration work. If necessary, Adobe can recommend some third-party firms who can be engaged to create the integration.

<a id="enterprise-faq"></a>
## Enterprise FAQ

<a id="do-i-need-to-sign-a-contract-to-build-my-enterprise-integration"></a>
### Do I need to sign a contract to build my Enterprise integration?

<a id="is-there-a-separate-cost-to-use-the-stock-api"></a>

<a id="how-can-i-automate-my-stock-workflows"></a>

All Adobe Enterprise customers have access to a Service Account integration. The Service Account uses special credentials to authorize and access its Adobe licenses which do not require a user to sign in. Subsequently, this application can perform tasks on an automated scheduled with no user interaction.

Any Stock API may be used in an automated method. Examples include downloading new assets from a group’s license history, licensing assets in bulk (e.g., from a list of IDs), or integrating controls inside a corporate application which allow a non-Adobe user to download assets which have been previously licensed by a different user.
