# Sample code and SDKs

## Stock API SDKs
Adobe Stock has created SDK libraries to simplify the process of writing applications which consume the Stock APIs. These libraries act as "wrappers" around the Stock API methods, allowing the developers to call functions in their app that do the work of communicating with the Stock servers. This should minimize the risk of errors, and also speed up the time required to finish the application.

Adobe offers SDKs written in three languages: PHP, Java and JavaScript. Each page has a README with instructions on how to install, build and test the libraries. All are hosted as open source software by Adobe on GitHub.

## Stock sample code
The examples demonstrate how to use the Stock SDKs as well as how to generate service tokens.
