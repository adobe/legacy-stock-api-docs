# Adobe Stock application approval guidelines

Per the [Adobe Developer Terms of Use](http://www.adobe.com/go/developer-terms), Adobe reserves the right to restrict distribution of any Developer Software (including access to Services and Software by Developer Software) unless approved by Adobe.

## Required materials for submission
Developer should make all attempts to provide the following:

1.  Interactive UX mockup (e.g. Adobe XD or Envision demo) that allows a click-through demo of functionality. If available, provided when integration work is about to begin.
2.  If #2 is not available, provide a PDF/static mockup of site showing the user journey and graphics used. This should be made available to Adobe when UX designs have been approved internally by the partner.
3.  Login to a functional site where the integration can be tested, along with either a demo or basic instructions of how to use. This will be provided ideally 1-2 weeks+ before releasing to production.
4.  Example of end-user documentation that will be provided to users.

## Review process

+ Partner will provide a demo/walkthrough of the integration, with some instructions or documentation how Adobe can discover and use the functionality.
+ Once reviewed, Adobe will approve, unless changes are needed prior to approval (see next item). For future updates by developer, review is not necessary unless there is a major change in UX. 
+ Partner will provide a change management process, including (a) how Adobe can request changes, (b) expected timeframe for changes to be made, (c) length of time that changes will still be accepted.
